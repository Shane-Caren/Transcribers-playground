## Design

### Colour Scheme

The two main colours used are dark slate blue, and gold.

### Typography

The Open Sans font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Open Sans is a clean font used frequently for typed documents, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

### Imagery

Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be subtle and not distract the user. It also has a modern, mellow aesthetic.
